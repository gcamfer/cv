## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **Lack of Quantifiable Achievements** 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** All work experience entries list responsibilities without measurable outcomes.

**Example of current approach:**
> "Developing metrics to analyse the quality of maps for ADAS attributes"

**Why this is problematic:**
- Doesn't show impact or scale
- No business value demonstrated
- Could apply to anyone doing similar work
- ATS systems look for numbers and results

### 2. **Vague Professional Summary** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** The summary is too generic and doesn't lead with your strongest value proposition.

**Current issues:**
- Opens with education rather than impact
- "Always looking for new challenges" is passive
- Doesn't quantify your 7+ years of experience
- Mentions hobbies (electronics, pentesting) that dilute professional focus

### 3. **No Business Context** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem:** Work descriptions focus on technical tasks without explaining business problems solved or stakeholder value delivered.

### 4. **Weak Action Verbs** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem:** Using weak verbs like "working on," "developing," instead of impact verbs like "delivered," "optimized," "reduced," "increased."

### 5. **Missing Technical Leadership Indicators** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
For a Senior level position, missing indicators of:
- Team leadership or mentorship
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Architecture decisions
- Technical strategy

### 📊 Skills Section

**Current State:** Good categorization but could be strengthened

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add "Model Deployment & Production"** category:
   - CI/CD for ML
   - Model Monitoring
   - A/B Testing
   - Feature Stores

2. **Strengthen MLOps section** with:
   - Kubernetes (if you have experience)
   - Terraform/Infrastructure as Code
   - Model Versioning
   - Experiment Tracking (MLflow, W&B)

3. **Add Cloud Platforms**:
   - Azure (you have certifications)
   - AWS (if applicable)
   - GCP (if applicable)

4. **Consider adding "Soft Skills"** briefly:
   - Cross-functional collaboration
   - Technical mentorship
   - Stakeholder management

---

### 🎓 Education

**Current State:** Good but thesis titles could be more impactful

**Recommendation:** Add one-sentence impact statement for Master's thesis:

```yaml
thesis:
  title: "Reinforcement learning as a reaction to network anomalies"
  url: "http://uvadoc.uva.es/handle/10324/33081"
  impact: "Proposed novel adversarial RL algorithm, published in Computer Networks journal (2019)"
```

---

### 🏆 Certifications

**Excellent!** Recent Databricks certs are highly valuable.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Add expiry awareness**: Consider renewing Azure Data Scientist Associate since it expired in 2022

2. **Prioritize order** (most recent/valuable first):
   - ✅ Current order is good

3. **Add credential URLs** where possible for verification

---

### 📚 Courses Section

**Current State:** Appropriately de-emphasized, but perhaps too many (17 courses)

**Recommendation:**

Keep only the most relevant/recent (6-8 courses):
- Faster Python Code (2024)
- Generative AI and LLMOps (2024)
- Advanced Deep Learning with Keras
- PyTorch courses
- SQL Bootcamp (always relevant)

Remove older Udemy courses from 2018-2019 as they add less value.
